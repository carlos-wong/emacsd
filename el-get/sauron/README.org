* sauron

  *WARNING* sauron is in its early stages of development. Okay, now I warned
  you.

** what is it?

   *sauron* is an emacs mode for keeping track of /events/ happening in the
   (emacs) world around you. Events are things like 'appointment in 5 minutes',
   'bob pinged you on IRC', 'torrent download is complete' etc. Sauron shows
   those events like a list -- basically like a log. You can 'activate' an event
   by either pressing =RET= when point is on it, or clicking it with the middle
   mouse button (=<mouse-2>=).

   When activated, it can execute some arbitrary function -- for example in the
   case of IRC (ERC), it will switch you to the buffer (channel) it originated
   from. It's a bit of a generalization of what /tracking mode/ does in ERC (the
   emacs IRC client), and that is in fact how it started.

   For my work, I need to keep track of a bunch of internal ERC (IRC) channels
   and at the same time not forget to go to meetings, even when I'm
   concentrating on something else. So, I want something tweakable to provide me
   with the right balance between obnoxiousness and ignorability. Thus, sauron
   was born.

   There's an increasing number of hooks and tunables in sauron, which allows
   you to fine-tune the behavior. However, I strive for it to be useful with
   minimal configuration.

** getting started

   After you've put the various sauron files in a directory, you can enable it
   with something like the following in your =.emacs=:

   ;; set load path, obviously replace "<path-to-sauron-dir>" with the actual path...
   #+being_example
:   (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-sauron-dir>")
:   (require 'sauron)
   #end_example

   Now, you can start sauron with... =M-x sauron-start=, and stop it with =M-x
   sauron-stop=.

   =sauron-start= will pop-up a new frame (window) which will show events coming
   from any of its sources (i.e.., ERC, org-mode appointments and over
   d-bus). You can 'activate' a source by pressing "Enter" with the cursor on
   the event, which will then take some backend-specific action.

   For example, for the ERC-backend, it will transfer you to the buffer
   (IRC-channel) where said event happened.

   You can clear all events with =M-x sauron-clear= (default keybinding: =c=).

   Sauron (by default) loads the =sauron-erc=, =sauron-org= and =sauron-dbus=
   modules; if you don't have ERC, org-mode or d-bus support, these will simply
   be ignored. If so desired, you can customize =sauron-modules=. See below for
   some specifics about the backends.


** customization

   I've tried hard to come up with reasonable defaults, such that users can get
   started with sauron without reading too much documentation or having to write
   emacs-lisp etc.; still, I've also tried to make sauron very configurable -
   different people have different needs, so it should be possible to coerce the
   software in whatever direction.

   Below are some customization points.

*** priorities -- =sauron-min-priority=

    Each event in sauron has a certain /priority/. Sauron *ignores* all events
    which have a priority that is lower that =sauron-min-priority= (default
    value: 3).

    For example, all messages written on IRC (i.e., coming from the ERC-backend)
    which are *not* directed towards you have priority 2 -- you will not see
    them. And that is probably a good idea.

*** watching patterns -- =sauron-watch-patterns=

    You can specify a list of patterns (regular expressions) which sauron should
    check. An event matching any of the patterns in the list will have its
    priority raised by 1 point. If that one point raises it to
    `sauron-min-priority' or higher level, it will now show up in the Sauron
    buffer.

    =sauron-watch-patterns= is useful if you want to check if, for example, your
    name, or your hobby project is mentioned in some IRC channel.

    So, for example, as part of your settings:
#+begin_example
:;; watch for some animals
:(setq sauron-watch-patterns
:  '("\\bgnu\\b" "yak" "capybara" "wombat"))
#+end_example

*** watching nicks -- =sauron-watch-nicks=

    You can also specify a list of nicks to watch for; nicks are matched using a
    string-match (not a regular expression). A nick matching any of the nicks in
    the list will have its priority raised by 1 point. If that one point raises
    it to `sauron-min-priority' or higher level, it will now show up in the
    Sauron buffer.

*** don't get swamped by a certain nick

    Since you may not want to get too many events from one nick -- and, who
    knows, accompanying sound effects, pop-ups and what have you, you can set
    some insensitivity time; events from the same nick during this time will be
    lowered in priority by one point.

    You can set the time period (in seconds) with `sauron-nick-insensitivity',
    which defaults to 60 seconds.

*** blocking events from showing up -- =sauron-event-block-functions=

    We can customize things even more precisely using the
    =sauron-event-block-functions= hook function. Any event with a priority >=
    =sauron-min-priority= will be passed to the hook function(s); if any of
    those functions returns non-nil, the event will be blocked. See the emacs
    documentation for a general introduction to hook functions, here's an
    example:
    #+begin_example
    :(add-hook 'sauron-event-block-functions
:  (lambda (origin prio msg &optional props)
:    (or
:      (string-match "foo" msg) ;; ignore events that match 'foo'
:      ;; other matchers
:     )))
    #+end_example

    Note that the =props= parameter is a backend specific property-list, which
    allows you e.g. (for the ERC-backend) to get the sender of some ERC message,
    and block based on that.

*** doing stuff based on events -- =sauron-event-added-functions=

    After events have been added, another hook is called:
    =sauron-event-added-functions=.

    This is place to add sound effects, notifications and so on. After all, if
    you get an event for e.g. the org-mode backend that you have a meeting to
    attend in 5 minutes, simply adding a line in the Sauron-buffer may not be
    enough.

    Instead, you can define a hook function for this.

    For doing very sound effects, pop-ups etc., a few
    convenience functions are provided:
    - ~sauron-fx-sox~ (play a sound using 'sox')
    - ~sauron-fx-aplay~ (play a sound using 'aplay')
    - ~sauron-fx-gnome-osd~ (show some letters on your screen)
    - ~sauron-fx-zenity~ (pop up a zenity window)
    - ~sauron-fx-notify~ (trigger a notification using the D-Bus notification daemon)
    (see the doc-strings for the functions for the details about their
    parameters).

    Now, our hook function could look something like:

#+begin_example
:(add-hook 'sauron-event-added-functions
:  (lambda (origin prio msg &optional props)
:    (if (string-match "ping" msg)
:      (sauron-fx-sox "/usr/share/sounds/ping.wav")
:      (sauron-fx-sox "/usr/share/sounds/something-happened.wav"))
:    (when (>= prio 4)
:	(sauron-fx-sox "/usr/share/sounds/uhoh.wav")
:	(sauron-fx-gnome-osd msg 10))))
#+end_example

*** changing the looks of the sauron buffer

    You can customize the columns shown in the sauron buffer by setting
    =sauron-column-alist= - see its documentation.

** connecting to alert.el

   John Wiegley's [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert.el]] has a bit of overlap with sauron; however, I've added
   some wrapper function to make it trivial to feed sauron events into
   alert. Simply adding:
#begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'sauron-event-added-functions 'sauron-alert-el-adapter)
#end_src
   in your setup should do the trick (of course. alert.el must be loaded).


** the backend modules

   Currently, three backend modules have been implemented - ERC, org-mode and
   d-bus. Hopefully, more will follow.

*** erc

    The ERC module check all IRC PRIVMSG messages, and JOIN/LEAVE/QUIT
    messages. PRIVMSG includes the messages sent to any channel by anyone. These
    message are given (by default) priority 2, so (by default) they do not show
    up in your sauron buffer.

    However, messages that match one of your =sauron-watch-patterns= or
    =sauron-watch-nicks= are getting a higher priority, or messages that are
    private messages directed at you. However, after sending a message, you
    won't get notified from the same nick for another 60 seconds (by default --
    see =sauron-nick-insensitivity=), so you won't get e.g. sound effects for
    each message in a private conversation.

*** org-mode / appt

    For org-mode, sauron adds functionality to =appt-disp-window-function= (but
    leaves it intact), so that whenever some event is near, you get a
    notification with the following priorities:
    - 15 minutes left: priority 3
    - 10 minutes left: priority 3
    - 5  minutes left: priority 4
    - 2  minutes left: priority 5
    For all other minutes, you'll get events with priority 2.

    You should load org /before/ starting sauron, in particular before you set
    ~appt-disp-window-function~, as sauron-org uses that same function (it will
    preserve the existing functionality though).

*** d-bus

    The dbus backend allows you to get events from outside emacs; it listens for
    two messages, =AddUrlEvent= and =AddMsgEvent=. You can call them like this:

#+begin_src sh
:    dbus-send --session --dest="org.gnu.Emacs"	   \
:    "/org/gnu/Emacs/Sauron"                       \
:    "org.gnu.Emacs.Sauron.AddUrlEvent"            \
:    string:shell uint32:3 string:"Link: Emacs-Fu" \
:    string:"http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com"
#+end_src
The four parameters are resp. the sender ('shell'), the priority ('3' in the
example), a description and a URL. This will show up in the sauron buffer (if
the priority is high enough), and if you activate the event (press RET), your
browser will visit the link.

#+begin_src sh
:    dbus-send --session          	          \
:    --dest="org.gnu.Emacs"	                  \
:     "/org/gnu/Emacs/Sauron"                     \
:    "org.gnu.Emacs.Sauron.AddMsgEvent"           \
:    string:shell uint32:3 string:"Hello, world!"
#+end_src
The three parameters are resp. the sender ('shell'), the priority ('3' in the
example), and message. This will show up in the sauron buffer (if the priority
is high enough).

One use for these kind of messages is to warn you when for example a torrent has
been completed in 'Transmission'. In the torrent-completion script (see Preferences/
Call-script-when-torrent-is-completed), add something like:
#+begin_src sh
:    dbus-send --session          	          \
:    --dest="org.gnu.Emacs"	                  \
:     "/org/gnu/Emacs/Sauron"                     \
:    "org.gnu.Emacs.Sauron.AddMsgEvent"           \
:    string:Transmission uint32:3 string:"Torrent completed: $TR_TORRENT_NAME"
#+end_src

I'm sure you can think of other useful applications.

**** Using D-Bus outside your session

Note, you normally only use D-Bus (i.e.., the d-bus session bus) when you are in
the same /session/ -- say, your desktop environment. Thus, it is generally /not/
possible to send yourself D-Bus messages from programs outside your session, for
example something running from ~crontab~.

For this, if you set =sauron-dbus-cookie= to non-nil (before starting sauron),
it will drop a file =~/.sauron-dbus= which contains the D-Bus session bus
address (=DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=). Using this address you can, in fact, send
messages to sauron from outside your session, by doing something like in the
previous examples, but first setting =DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=: 
#+begin_src sh
:DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="`cat ~/.sauron-dbus`" dbus-send ....
#+end_src

We don't write =~/.sauron-dbus= as their may be security downsides to this -
even though normally other users are not allowed to send to 'your' session bus,
even with the cookie, it's always good to be a bit paranoid.

** adding new modules

   It may be interesting to track other modules as well; this shouldn't be too
   hard. Suppose we have a module 'foo':

   - create "sauron-foo.el", and make sure it's in the load-path
   - sauron-foo should implement at least:
     + ~sauron-foo-start~ to start the module
     + ~sauron-foo-stop~ to stop the module / cleanup etc.
   - add sauron-foo.el with =(provide 'sauron-foo)=
   - now, add ~sauron-foo~ to your ~sauron-modules~

   Now, to actually make your module useful, you'd want to add some event is
   something happens. This is done using =sauron-add-event= (see it's
   documentation).

** Using =sauron= from your other modules

   If you want to create simple sauron-events from other elisp code, writing a
   backend modules might be unnecessary; you can simply call the
   =sauron-add-event= function directly. See its docstring for the details. Example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
:(sauron-add-event
:   'kitchen           ;; origin
:   3                  ;; priority
:   "Coffee is ready!"
:   '(lambda ()        ;; function called when activated
:      (message "Coffee's ready, get it while it's hot!"))
:   '(:temperature 80)) ;; arbitrary props passed to
:                       ;; hook functions
#+end_src

   A typical pattern may also be to switch to the buffer of origin when the
   event is activated. The =sauron-switch-to-buffer= function may be useful
   there, as it tries to ensure that the buffer is shown in the /other/ frame
   (not the one with Sauron).


** sample configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
:(require 'sauron)
:
: ;; note, you add (setq sauron-debug t) to get errors which can debug if
: ;; there's something wrong; normally, we catch such errors, since e.g an error
: ;; in one of the hooks may cause ERC to fail (i.e., the message won't come
: ;; trough).
:
:(setq
:  sauron-max-line-length 120
:
:  ;; you probably want to add your own nickname to the these patterns
:  sauron-watch-patterns
:  '("emacs-fu" "emacsfu" "wombat" "capybara" "yak" "gnu" "\\bmu\\b")
:
:  ;; you probably want to add you own nick here as well
:  sauron-watch-nicks
:  '("Tom" "Dick" "Harry"))
:
:;; some sound/light effects for certain events
:(add-hook 'sauron-event-added-functions
:  (lambda (origin prio msg &optional props)
:    (if (string-match "ping" msg)
:      (sauron-fx-sox "/usr/share/sounds/ping.wav"))
:    (cond
:      ((= prio 3) (sauron-fx-sox "/usr/share/sounds/pling.wav"))
:      ((= prio 4) (sauron-fx-sox "/usr/share/sounds/plong.wav"))
:      ((= prio 5)
:	(sauron-fx-sox "/usr/share/sounds/alarm.wav")
:	(sauron-fx-gnome-osd(format "%S: %s" origin msg) 5)))))
:
:;; events to ignore
:(add-hook 'sauron-event-block-functions
:  (lambda (origin prio msg &optional props)
:    (or
:      (string-match "^*** Users" msg)))) ;; don't notify on IRC spam
#+end_src
